# Workday-Calendar

# Description

I used HTML to add time blocks to the calendar.
I used vanilla JavaScript to make the page more interactive. See screenshots below: 



# The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

# Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

#When I refresh the page the saved events persist
